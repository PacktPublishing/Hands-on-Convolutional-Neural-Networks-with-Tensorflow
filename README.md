**Solve computer vision problems with modeling in TensorFlow and Python**

## What is this book about?
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are one of the most popular architectures used in computer vision apps. This book is an introduction to CNNs through solving real-world problems in deep learning while teaching you their implementation in popular Python library - TensorFlow. By the end of the book, you will be training CNNs in no time!

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Train machine learning models with TensorFlow
* Create systems that can evolve and scale during their life cycle
* Use CNNs in image recognition and classification
* Use TensorFlow for building deep learning models 
* Train popular deep learning models

## Get to Know the Authors
**Iffat Zafar**
was born in Pakistan. She received her Ph.D. from the Loughborough University in Computer Vision and Machine Learning in 2008. After her Ph.D. in 2008, she worked as research associate at the Department of Computer Science, Loughborough University, for about 4 years. She currently works in the industry as an AI engineer, researching and developing algorithms using Machine Learning and Deep Learning for object detection and general Deep Learning tasks for edge and cloud-based applications.

**Giounona Tzanidou**
is a PhD in computer vision from Loughborough University, UK, where she developed algorithms for runtime surveillance video analytics. Then, she worked as a research fellow at Kingston University, London, on a project aiming at prediction detection and understanding of terrorist interest through intelligent video surveillance. She was also engaged in teaching computer vision and embedded systems modules at Loughborough University. Now an engineer, she investigates the application of deep learning techniques for object detection and recognition in videos.

**Richard Burton**
graduated from the University of Leicester with a master's degree in mathematics. After graduating, he worked as a research engineer at the University of Leicester for a number of years, where he developed deep learning object detection models for their industrial partners. Now, he is working as a software engineer in the industry, where he continues to research the applications of deep learning in computer vision.

**Nimesh Patel**
graduated from the University of Leicester with an MSc in applied computation and numerical modeling. During this time, a project collaboration with one of University of Leicesterâ€™s partners was undertaken, dealing with Machine Learning for Hand Gesture recognition. Since then, he has worked in the industry, researching Machine Learning for Computer Vision related tasks, such as Depth Estimation.

**Leonardo Araujo**
is just the regular, Brazilian, curious engineer, who has worked in the industry for the past 19 years (yes, in Brazil, people work before graduation), doing HW/SW development and research on the topics of control engineering and computer vision. For the past 6 years, he has focused more on Machine Learning methods. His passions are too many to put on the book.
